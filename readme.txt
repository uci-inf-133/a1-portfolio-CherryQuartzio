--Readme document for Quang Nguyen, quangmn4@uci.edu--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

10/10
- 1/1 Readme
- 2/2 Basic HTML content
- 1/1 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 2/2 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 2/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features

 - At least one image, with descriptive alt attribute(s)
 - Appropriate headings and paragraph text
 - Links to external page(s)
 - Semantic HTML tags like aside or footer

(b) CSS features

 - Modifying padding and margins to indent content and enhance readability
 - Modifying link, text color, or other colors to be visually appealing, perhaps with one of the pallette creators in the resources tab

(c) Advanced features

 - A contact form which leverages HTML forms


3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.

   The accessibility checker did throw out 50 potential errors with no known and likely problem. I've decided to ignore all the potential errors, since they won't go away despite me doing
   everything by standard.
   
   Most of them are visual and attribute errors that should not exist, such as the fact that my image does have an alt text that properly convey the content, and that the headers are indeed used for  organizational. Some of them are more language related that only exists in code 
   and is not visible on the rendered page. Remainder issues are related to the contact form.
   
   The contact form itself is intentionally made to be non-functional for the purpose of this assignments due to requiring Javascript and additional backend code. The accessibility checker also complain about certain aspect of its usability, which I can ignore for now.

4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?

   Combined, it likely took me a total of 20 hours to do this assignment.

5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)

 The following documentations were mainly used:
 - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML
 - https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp
 
 Generative AI were only used to know how to do a specific CSS styling to an element and the attributes to use

6. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?

   I did not consult anyone else for this assignment. All work is my own.

7. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?

   No, as long as all files from the submission are all in the same directory.
